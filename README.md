# Automated-Medical-Diagnosis-Using-Computer-Vision

This is an applied computer vision project, which aims to detect a certain medical condition using CV techniques.
In our case it is detection of pneumonia.
The Chest X-Ray Images dataset contained images of varying sizes and resolutions. The images were resized to 224x224 and converted to grayscale. The dataset is imbalanced, with around 70% of the images labeled as pneumonia. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets with a 70:10:20 ratio.
The models folder has the models used in this project.
The main.py file has the code used to run the train and test functions and print the accuracy.
